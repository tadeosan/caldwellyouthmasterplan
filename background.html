        <h3>Why Revise the Plan?</h3>
        <p>After five years of implementation, we recognized the need to revisit and revise our masterplan for several important reasons:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Changing Demographics:</strong> Caldwell has experienced significant population changes since 2020, with more diverse youth populations requiring tailored approaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Pandemic Impact:</strong> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to influence youth development, educational outcomes, and mental health needs.</li>
          <li><strong>New Research:</strong> Emerging research on youth development and effective intervention strategies has provided new insights that should be incorporated into our approach.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Ongoing evaluation and community input have highlighted both successes and gaps in our current programming.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Our Revision Process</h3>
        <p>In early 2025, we began a comprehensive revision process that involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gathering updated data on youth needs and outcomes</li>
          <li>Conducting new community engagement sessions</li>
          <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of current programs</li>
          <li>Exploring innovative approaches used successfully in other communities</li>
          <li>Developing updated goals and implementation strategies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We expect to complete the revised masterplan by December 2025, with implementation beginning in January 2026.</p>
