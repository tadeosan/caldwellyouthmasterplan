        <h3>The Original Plan</h3>
        <p>The Caldwell Youth Master Plan was originally apdoted on November 7th, 2011. The plan was an initiative by the City of Caldwell, alongside the Caldwell School District and other community stakeholders, to improve the daily lives of the youth. The plan was designed to create a healthy, safe, and service oriented community for youths in Caldwell. The plan aimed to be this by making 12 promises addressing 12 different issues youth may face in Caldwell. </p>
        
        <p>12 Promises:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Children and young adults will be protected from bullying and abuse from adults and peers</li>
          <li>Children and youth will have safe places to gather where they can learn, grow and access educational resources</li>
          <li>Children and young adults will be aware of any after-school opportunities</li>
          <li>Children and youth will be provided with a means of transportation to participate in out-of-school activities</li>

          <li>Parents and Children will be educated on nutrition and healthy food options</li>
          <li>Children and young adults will have access to healthy foods, active lifestyles choices and protection against preventable disease</li>
          <li>Children will be encourages to pursue post-secondary-educational opportunities</li>
          <li>Young adults will be taught basic job skills and prepared to be productive members of the workforce</li>

          <li>Children and young adults will be aware of and encouraged to participate in volunteer opportunities</li>
          <li>Children will be given an active voice in the community and have the opportunity to learn about decision and policy making</li>
          <li>Children and young adults will be educated on proper social etiquette to help them succeed in the workforce and community</li>
          <li>Youth will be taught and encouraged to use various forms of communication in order to voice their opinions respectfully and confront and resolve personal and social issues</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>When first presented with the master plan, we noticed that it was outdated and focused mainly on physical health. We decided to research the potential of adding it as a category and interviewed individuals to figure out if the goals of the original master plan were met. Our goal was to increase knowledge about the resources available, widening the conversation from just mental health organizations to organizations youth can connect to in order to lessen the rising mental health issues arising, and perhaps inspire a new organization for older youths.</p>

        <h3>Why Revise the Plan?</h3>
        <p>After five years of implementation, we recognized the need to revisit and revise our masterplan for several important reasons:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Changing Demographics:</strong> Caldwell has experienced significant population changes since 2020, with more diverse youth populations requiring tailored approaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Pandemic Impact:</strong> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to influence youth development, educational outcomes, and mental health needs.</li>
          <li><strong>New Research:</strong> Emerging research on youth development and effective intervention strategies has provided new insights that should be incorporated into our approach.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Feedback:</strong> Ongoing evaluation and community input have highlighted both successes and gaps in our current programming.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Our Revision Process</h3>
        <p>In early 2025, we began a comprehensive revision process that involves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gathering updated data on youth needs and outcomes</li>
          <li>Conducting new community engagement sessions</li>
          <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of current programs</li>
          <li>Exploring innovative approaches used successfully in other communities</li>
          <li>Developing updated goals and implementation strategies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We expect to complete the revised masterplan by December 2025, with implementation beginning in January 2026.</p>
